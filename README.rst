Exp. All provides a mechanism for distributing half of the experience gained in a battle to each Pokemon in your party. Unfortunately, we haven't yet figured out how to take advantage of this item in Python.

What we decided to do instead was use a machine learning approach, inspired by the field of natural language procseesing (NLP), to predict protein expression directly from protein sequence. Hopefully you will find this equally exciting.
